<p>
    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
    came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
    decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
    also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
    superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
    business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
            youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA
            2770. While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle of
            Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and
            at some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a
            shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which remained with him even in death.

        <h3>Fíli and Kíli</h3>
        <p>Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews
            of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.</p>

        <h3>Bifur</h3>
        <p>
            Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not related to the royal House of Durin.
            Most of his familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his
            family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in
            exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life at his
            halls in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.

        <h3>Bofur</h3>
        <p>
            Bofur was a Dwarf who lived in the late Third Age. He is best known as a companion of Bilbo Baggins, Thorin
            Oakenshield, and Gandalf on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, along with his
            brother Bombur and cousin Bifur.

    <div class="col-md-7">
        <h3>Bombur</h3>
        <p>
            Bombur's parentage is unknown. He was the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's
            line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown, though it fell
            somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen "by some
            fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and
            Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey,
            Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.

    <h3>Gandalf</h3>
    <p>
        Gandalf, known temporarily as the Grey and later the White, and originally named Olórin (Quenya), was an Istar
        (Wizard), dispatched to Middle-earth in the Third Age to combat the threat of Sauron. He joined Thorin II and
        his company to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, helped form the Fellowship of the Ring to destroy the One
        Ring, and led the Free Peoples of the World in the final campaign of the War of the Ring.
